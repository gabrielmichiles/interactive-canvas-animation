# Interactive Canvas Animation

An interactive canvas animation with randomly generated rectangles that move and react to a pointer.

## Getting Started

1. Open the HTML file containing the canvas (index.html) in a web browser.
2. Move the mouse to control the pointer. Moving the pointer close to another rectangle will push it away.
3. Rectangles will change color on collision with the pointer.
4. Click and hold the mouse button to attract rectangles and change their colors.

## Features

- Dynamic rendering of randomly generated rectangles on a canvas.
